# Voluntrack
This is a web application that will allow an organization to keep track of their volunteers, events, and create user accounts for their volunteers.

## Express/Passport with React
This version uses React to control the login requests and redirection in coordination with client-side routing.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you have the following software installed on your computer:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [PostrgeSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- [Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/)

## Create database and table

Create a new database called `voluntrack` and create a `person` table:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE person (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR (80) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password VARCHAR (1000) NOT NULL
);
```

## Development Setup Instructions

* Run `npm install`
* Create a `.env` file at the root of the project and paste this line into the file:
    ```
    SERVER_SESSION_SECRET=superDuperSecret
    ```
    While you're in your new `.env` file, take the time to replace `superDuperSecret` with some long random string like `25POUbVtx6RKVNWszd9ERB9Bb6` to keep your application secure. Here's a site that can help you: [https://passwordsgenerator.net/](https://passwordsgenerator.net/). If you don't do this step, create a secret with less than eight characters, or leave it as `superDuperSecret`, you will get a warning.
* Start postgres if not running already by using `brew services start postgresql`
* Run `npm run server`
* Run `npm run client`
* Navigate to `localhost:3000`
